# Project Instructions

## Running the Code
The code can be executed immediately after downloading the project.

## Creating a New Model
To create a new model, set `create_model` to `TRUE` in **line 377**.  
By default, the code is designed to load a pre-trained, optimal model named `model_number1.h5`, which is included in the project.

## Calculating Metrics
To calculate metrics (minimum, mean, and maximum error) on the test dataset, set `calculate_mean` to `TRUE` in **line 394**.  
This will also apply the defined threshold and generate the confusion matrix.
